📄 Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Top 500 most subscribed YouTube channels worldwide, aiming to uncover patterns in channel growth, category-based performance, audience engagement, and content trends. Using real-world data, the analysis highlights what makes top YouTubers successful and supports data-driven decision-making for content strategies.

🎯 Aim
Design and execute an end-to-end EDA project to analyze YouTube’s most popular channels and reveal insights on subscriber trends, viewership patterns, and category performance.

Dataset: Collected 1,020 rows × 11 columns containing channel names, subscribers, views, uploads, categories, and other metrics.

Data Cleaning:

Removed 509 duplicate entries for uniqueness.

Handled missing values and ensured consistency.

Feature Engineering: Expanded to 21 columns by creating meaningful derived metrics.

Visualization: Created impactful visuals to communicate insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

🏆 Achievements
